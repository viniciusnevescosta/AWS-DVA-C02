## Overview
- Identity and Acess Management - Global Service.
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.
- Groups only contain users.
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.
### Permissions
- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- These policies define the **permissions** of the user
- In AWS you apply the **least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than a user needs.
## Policies
- In AWS we have group policies that affect all the users within the group.
- But, we also have inline policies that could be applied to solo users.
