## Overview
- Identity and Acess Management - Global Service.
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.
- Groups only contain users.
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and a user can belong to multiple groups.

## Permissions
- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- These policies define the **permissions** of the user
- In AWS you apply the **least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than a user needs.
## Policies
- In AWS we have group policies that affect all the users within the group.
- But, we also have inline policies that could be applied to solo users.
### Structure
- **Version:** Policy language version, always include "2012-10-17".
- **Id (optional):** Identifier for the policy.
- **Statement (required):** One or more individual statements.
### Statements consists of
- **Sid (optional):** An identifier for the statement.
- **Effect (optional):** Whether the statement allows or denies acess.
- **Principal:** account/user/role to which this policy is applied to.
- **Action:** List of actions this policy allows or denies.
- **Resource:** List of resources to which the actions applied to.
- **Condition (optional):** Conditions for when this policy is in effect.
