## How to choose an AWS region?
1. Compliance: Sometimes the company wants the data to be in the same country they are. 
2. Proximity: To reduce latency.
3. Available services: Not all services are available in all the regions.
4. Pricing: The services pricing could change depending on the country.

## AWS Availability Zones
- Each region has at least 3 AZs and the maximum of 6.
- Redundant power, networking and connectivity.
- They're separate from each other, so they're isolated from disasters.

## AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency.
